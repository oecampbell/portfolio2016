[Static AirBnB](https://oecampbell.github.io/airbnb-static/) the purpose of this exercise was to gain practice using boostrap, JavaScript for inserting Google Maps and reusing UI components.

It did not take long to implement as I reused code from previous exercises the tricky part was the google maps as you can see on my live site it does not work as I need to register for a Google API key for the map to display publicly.

To go further with this project I would insert a date picker so you can select your check in and check out dates in the banner.
