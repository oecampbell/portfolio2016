[Wagon Race JS Game](https://oecampbell.github.io/Wagon-Race/) was part of a one day workshop to grasp the concept of JavaScript events and callbcks. The task was to build a simple JavaScript game where 2 players can race their wagons by pressing akey to move forwards.

The first part of binding the keys was fairly straight forward but then trying to work out how to make the wagons move forward when a click event occured was the real challenge.

Most of my classmates ended up with a series of if statments followed by counters which was really confusing to understand.I chose to focus on using the cells and reading documentations online instead.
