        <p>I gained great happiness from doing Design Technology and Graphic Design during my education because it allowed me to take ownership of my creative work. I wanted to create a career where I can continue learning, collaborating with other like-minded people, and contributing to open source projects.</p> <p> To acquire these skills I attended Le Wagon London (Batch #36) 9 week intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery, SQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. </p>
